# Step 12 — Legal Posture

**Goal:** the founder's articulated legal posture for v1 — terms model, privacy stance (regulation applicability + data flows + retention), data-handling commitments, license choices (own license + OSS components), regulated-aspect treatments, and AI-specific posture when applicable. This is a synthesis document — a structured inventory the founder hands to outside counsel for a productive 30-minute conversation, NOT a substitute for the actual terms / privacy policy / DPA artifacts that qualified counsel must draft.

**Mode:** `synthesis` with `delegable: true`. Fully delegable — the sub-agent reads prior artifacts (PRD + system-design + cost-estimate + roadmap + brand) and produces the posture document with no live parent interview. The product class + jurisdiction + stack signals are extracted from the prior artifacts mechanically; the posture is a structural inventory anchored against those signals.

**Output file:** `legal-posture.md` in `docs/`. Single-artifact — no `extra_files`.

**Gate behavior:** step 12 closes the Specification phase gate (`GATE_AFTER` in `src/pipeline.ts` is `[4, 7, 12]`). After a clean submit + `product_advance`, the response is `code: "gate-required", phase: "specification"`. Parent confirms with user, calls `product_gate_pass("specification")`, then `product_advance` again to enter step 13 (prototype-v3 — the visual contract). Step 12 is NOT the final step — step 13 closes the pipeline.

## How to conduct this step

Read `references/privacy-matrix-shape.md` for the controller-vs-processor framing + GDPR / LGPD / CCPA matrix shape + sub-processor disclosure discipline + 72-hour breach notification (GDPR Art 33) + DPIA trigger heuristics (high-risk processing under GDPR Art 35). Read `references/oss-license-matrix.md` for the MIT / Apache 2.0 / LGPL / GPL / AGPL compatibility table + SaaS implications (AGPL network copyleft is the load-bearing warning) + license-choice rationale. Read `references/regulated-aspects-checklist.md` for the HIPAA / COPPA / PCI / SOC 2 / GLBA / FERPA / AI Act trigger + posture-decision-per-trigger + when-to-engage-counsel discipline.

### 1. Read everything prior

- **PRD** — `docs/prd/v1.md` — § Users / Audience drives the regulation applicability (EU residents → GDPR; California residents → CCPA / CPRA; Brazil residents → LGPD; minors → COPPA / GDPR Art 8; employees → state employment privacy laws); § Goals + § Success Metrics drive the v1 user-volume estimate (drives DPIA trigger — large-scale processing under GDPR Art 35); § User Stories drive what data is collected per flow.
- **System design** — `docs/system-design.md` — § Data Model is the authoritative source for what PII is collected; § Integrations names every third-party sub-processor (Stripe, Auth0 / Supabase, OpenAI / Anthropic, Sentry, PostHog, SendGrid / Resend, etc); § Stack drives OSS-component inventory (every npm / cargo / pip dependency in production is a license-compatibility question); § Deployment drives data-residency posture (US-region vs EU-region vs multi-region); § Non-Functional § Security drives the encryption-at-rest / encryption-in-transit + backup-retention commitments.
- **Security** — `docs/security.md` — compliance posture (LGPD / GDPR / SOC 2 pre-work named here) drives § Regulated Aspects rows; OWASP threat-model surfaces the breach-notification context; auth model (OAuth scopes, session storage, MFA posture) drives the data-handling row on access controls.
- **Cost estimate** — `docs/cost-estimate.md` — § Run Cost line items include DPA fees + legal review allocation + (when applicable) SOC 2 audit fees + outside-counsel retainer; this anchors the timing of when counsel-review checkpoints fire in § Open Decisions.
- **Roadmap** — `docs/roadmap.md` — § Horizon § External coordination names the legal-review trigger week (typically late in Polish + Launch phase); § Open Decisions may carry a legal-related deferred decision (e.g. "EU region deferred to v2 — flip if first EU customer requests data residency").
- **Brand** — `docs/brand.md` — voice (consumer-friendly conversational vs enterprise-formal) calibrates the terms-of-service tone; a B2B SaaS targeting compliance teams must commit to enterprise-formal terms while a consumer mobile app can adopt plain-language ToS.
- **Architecture JSON** — `docs/data-flow.json` — quick scan confirms the sub-processor list count + the data-flow shape (does data flow to an LLM at runtime? if yes, AI-specific posture fires).

### 2. Extract the 4 structural signals

The sub-agent reads the prior artifacts and extracts four signals that calibrate the posture document. NO live parent interview — these are mechanically extracted, NOT interview questions:

1. **Product class.** Consumer mobile (1 persona, B2C, app-store distribution) / B2B SaaS (workspace per customer, contract terms govern) / Developer tool (API / CLI / SDK distribution) / AI-stack (LLM in production data flow) / Regulated-vertical (health / fintech / education / employment). May overlap — a B2B SaaS with AI features in an EU-employee-data context is three overlapping classes.

2. **Jurisdiction exposure.** Where do users live? Where is data stored? Where is the company incorporated? Extract from PRD § Users (audience) + system-design § Deployment (data-residency) + a default-by-class heuristic when neither artifact names it (consumer-US-only → CCPA + applicable state laws; consumer-global → GDPR + LGPD + CCPA + PIPEDA; B2B-SaaS-with-EU-customers → GDPR is mandatory; AI-stack-with-EU-users → AI Act provisions starting Aug 2026).

3. **Sub-processor stack.** From system-design § Integrations. Every third-party that receives personal data is a sub-processor under GDPR Art 28 / LGPD Art 39. The list is exhaustive — Stripe, OpenAI, Auth0, Sentry, PostHog, Resend, AWS, Vercel, etc. Each row gets a 1-line treatment (purpose + DPA citation + cross-border transfer mechanism).

4. **AI-in-stack signal.** Does data flow to an LLM or generative model? If yes (system-design § Integrations names OpenAI / Anthropic / Cohere / Mistral / a self-hosted model), the § AI-Specific section fires. If no, § AI-Specific is omitted entirely (NOT emitted as `*N/A*` — silent omission is the clean shape).

These four signals drive product-class calibration (§ 5 below), regulation-matrix coverage (§ 4 below), and conditional-section inclusion (§ AI-Specific fires only when signal 4 is yes).

### 3. The escape clause — TOP of document

```markdown
> **This is the founder's articulated legal posture for v1, NOT legal advice.** Counsel review is required before launch. Real lawyers write the actual Terms of Service, Privacy Policy, Data Processing Agreement, and any regulated-aspect filings. This document exists to brief outside counsel and surface posture-level decisions the founder has made (or deliberately deferred).
```

Visibility matters — the escape clause sits at the TOP, NOT the bottom. This is the canonical counsel-disclaimer discipline.

### 4. The canonical posture structure

The sub-agent writes `legal-posture.md` against this 8-required spine (full shape lives in the references; AI-specific conditional fires only when signal 4 is yes — § 2 above):

1. **Overview** — short paragraph + 3 load-bearing one-liners (mirrors step-9 / 10 / 11 § Overview shape):
   - **Paragraph:** what's being articulated (v1 legal posture for outside-counsel briefing), which product class + jurisdiction exposure + AI-stack signal selected the calibration. Names the product class so depth-calibration is visible.
   - **Biggest legal risk:** one sentence naming THE posture decision most likely to require counsel rework. Anti-pattern: even-keeled risk distribution. Most v1 builds have ONE legal risk that dominates (employee-data-flowing-to-LLM, AGPL-component-in-SaaS-stack, EU-user-data-without-SCCs, COPPA-trigger-from-minor-users). Say it.
   - **Counsel-review timing:** one sentence naming WHEN outside counsel must engage (anchor against step-11 roadmap § Horizon § External coordination — typically late in Polish + Launch phase, 2-3 weeks before public launch).

2. **Terms of Service Posture** — what the v1 ToS commits to. NOT the actual ToS. Format:
   - **Acceptance model:** clickwrap (mandatory checkbox + "I agree" before account creation; the only defensible model for SaaS — browsewrap fails US enforceability tests) vs scroll-wrap (terms displayed in-app, acceptance is implicit-but-prompted). Default for B2B SaaS: clickwrap with a separate DPA acceptance flow for enterprise customers.
   - **Governing law:** jurisdiction (Delaware / California / UK / Brazil / EU) + venue (court vs arbitration; binding individual arbitration is the SaaS default in the US).
   - **Acceptable use:** the carve-outs (no scraping, no reverse-engineering, no using the service for illegal content, no spam). Concrete bullets, NOT "users must behave appropriately".
   - **Payment + cancellation:** subscription auto-renewal posture (the FTC's "Click-to-Cancel" rule applies for US consumer-facing subscriptions starting 2026); refund policy (pro-rata vs no-refund); chargeback handling.
   - **Limitation of liability + indemnification:** the cap (typically 12 months of fees paid, or $100, whichever is greater; B2B SaaS enterprise customers will negotiate this).
   - **Counsel-review checkpoint:** Outside counsel signs off on the actual ToS via 1-line email confirmation; the posture document does NOT substitute.

3. **Privacy Posture** — the regulation matrix + data flows + retention. The dense section. Format (subsectioned by user-flow when ≥3 distinct data-collection contexts exist — closes step-11's user-flow-shaped discipline):
   - **Applicable regulations.** Matrix table: `| Regulation | Trigger | Applicable? | Posture | Counsel review trigger |` — one row per relevant frame (GDPR for EU users; LGPD for Brazil users; CCPA / CPRA for California consumers; PIPEDA for Canada users; COPPA for minors under 13; HIPAA when health data; FERPA when education records).
   - **Controller vs processor role.** Declare per data flow — the company is *controller* for first-party data the user provides to use the product (account info, content the user creates); *processor* for data the customer's end-users generate when the product is B2B SaaS (customer is the controller, the company is the processor under DPA terms). Mixed models are common — explicit per-flow declaration prevents the "we're both controller and processor depending on context" ambiguity that fails GDPR Art 28 audits.
   - **Data categories + legal basis + retention table.** One row per data category: `| Data Category | Purpose | Legal Basis | Retention Period | Deletion Mechanism |`. Legal basis values: Consent (Art 6(1)(a)) / Contract (Art 6(1)(b)) / Legal Obligation (Art 6(1)(c)) / Vital Interest / Public Task / Legitimate Interest (Art 6(1)(f)). NOT "Consent for everything" — that's the dominant anti-pattern.
   - **Data subject rights — DSAR-window-per-regulation precision.** How users exercise access / deletion / portability / objection / rectification. Posture (in-app self-serve toggle vs email-to-DPO-then-SLA). The procedure exists; the actual UI / endpoint lives in the engineering spec (`/sdd new <slug>`). **DSAR response windows are per-regulation, NOT a blanket SLA** — GDPR Art 12: 30 days (extendable +60 for complex); LGPD Art 19: 15 days; CCPA / CPRA § 1798.130: 45 days (extendable +45); PIPEDA: 30 days. Default to the strictest applicable window when multiple regulations apply (typically LGPD's 15 days for products with any Brazilian user). Blanket "30-day response" is the regression mode — it under-serves LGPD subjects.
   - **GDPR article-grid matrix.** When GDPR applies AND the product is non-trivial (more than the smallest dev-tool class), include a sub-section table cross-referencing the load-bearing GDPR articles to implementation evidence: `| Article | Requirement | Applicable? | Control | Evidence location |`. Cover Articles 5 (principles) / 6 (lawful basis) / 7 (consent conditions) / 8 (child consent) / 12 (transparency) / 13 (info on data collection) / 14 (info when data not from subject) / 15-22 (data subject rights) / 24 (controller responsibility) / 25 (privacy by design) / 28 (processor / sub-processor) / 30 (records of processing) / 32 (security of processing) / 33 (72-hour breach to authority) / 34 (breach to data subject) / 35 (DPIA) / 37 (DPO designation) / 44-49 (international transfers). The fillable matrix template lives in `references/privacy-matrix-shape.md` § GDPR article-grid; the agent populates it with project-specific Control + Evidence-location entries. This grid is the reusable audit substrate counsel hands to enterprise customers during procurement.
   - **Cross-border transfers.** When data leaves the EU/UK/Brazil/etc, name the mechanism (Standard Contractual Clauses Module 2 for controller→processor; adequacy decision; Binding Corporate Rules). EU→US transfer without SCCs is the anti-pattern; even SaaS delivery counts as a transfer.
   - **DPIA trigger.** When high-risk processing fires (systematic monitoring; sensitive data at scale; automated decision-making; large-scale profiling — GDPR Art 35(3)). If any of these apply, DPIA is *mandatory before processing commences*. Mark `[DPIA Required]` inline; flag in § Open Decisions if not yet completed.

4. **Data Handling** — the technical-and-organizational measures. Format:
   - **Encryption posture:** at rest (AES-256 for database, encrypted secrets in environment variables) and in transit (TLS 1.3, HSTS enabled). Cite system-design § Non-Functional § Security for the actual implementation.
   - **Backup retention.** How long backups live; how they're rotated; how a user-deletion-request propagates to backups (typical posture: backups expire on a 30-day rotation; deletion requests are honored within the rotation window).
   - **Breach notification commitment.** 72-hour notification to supervisory authority (GDPR Art 33); without-undue-delay notification to affected data subjects (Art 34) when high risk. ANPD notification for LGPD breaches. Internal escalation playbook (who detects → who decides notification → who drafts the notice) lives in `security.md`; this section names the SLA commitment, NOT the playbook.
   - **Access controls.** Who internally accesses production data (engineering on-call only; support reads only the records the user references; full audit log per access). MFA mandatory for all production data access.
   - **Sub-processor disclosure.** Subsection table: `| Sub-processor | Purpose | Data Categories | DPA Reference | Cross-Border Mechanism |` — one row per third party. Stripe, Auth0/Supabase, OpenAI/Anthropic, Sentry, PostHog, Resend, AWS, Vercel/Neon. Each row cites the third party's published DPA. GDPR Art 28(2) requires the controller's general or specific prior authorization for each sub-processor — name them. **Sub-processor jurisdiction comes from `architecture.json` sub-component sublabel (e.g. PostHog `"cloud, EU region"`) OR cost-estimate § Run Cost source citation, NOT vendor HQ.** Listing PostHog as "UK" because Posthog Inc.'s HQ is in the UK when the architecture.json declares EU-Cloud regionalization is the regression the discipline catches — the regional deployment, not the corporate domicile, drives the cross-border mechanism column.
   - **Sub-processor row-lock to cost-estimate.** Sub-processor count MUST equal the cost-estimate § Run Cost vendor count. A 10-vendor cost-estimate produces a 10-row sub-processor table; a 6-vendor cost-estimate produces a 6-row table. Validator does NOT enforce this; the discipline is on the agent. Mismatches surface at counsel-review time as either "missing sub-processor" (Art 28(2) gap) or "ghost sub-processor" (referenced without a cost line — usually an artifact of the cost-estimate being out of date).

5. **Licensing** — own license + OSS components + patent posture + IP-assignment posture. Format:
   - **The product's own license.** For shipped product: MIT (most permissive, easy adoption — pick when the goal is broad ecosystem reuse) / Apache 2.0 (permissive with explicit patent grant — pick when the project will accept contributions from many parties) / AGPL v3 (network copyleft — pick when the goal is to force SaaS competitors to open-source their derivatives) / Proprietary / Source-Available (BUSL with delayed-open conversion) / commercial-only. The choice has consequences — see `references/oss-license-matrix.md`.
   - **OSS component compatibility.** Table: `| Component | License | Version | Use | Distribution Model | Copyleft Risk | Action Required |` — one row per critical OSS dependency. Flag any AGPL component in a SaaS stack as `Critical — network copyleft triggered`; recommend replacement or commercial license before launch. **Framework-level inventory is necessary but NOT sufficient — name the gap.** The agent acknowledges explicitly that the system-design § Stack table captures framework-level dependencies (Next.js, React, Prisma, …) while the actual `package-lock.json` / `Cargo.lock` / `poetry.lock` reality is 600-1500 transitive dependencies; a single AGPL-licensed transitive dep is the dominant probabilistic risk. The transitive audit (via `npx license-checker --excludePrivatePackages --onlyAllow 'MIT;Apache-2.0;BSD-2-Clause;BSD-3-Clause;ISC;MPL-2.0;PostgreSQL'`, `cargo-license`, `pip-licenses`, `go-licenses`) is a § Open Decisions row with deciding signal = end of polish phase / before public launch — NOT a v1 inline action.
   - **License-choice rationale.** One paragraph explaining WHY the license was picked. Without rationale, the choice is decorative.
   - **Patent strategy posture.** Single-line guidance for software-only v1 stacks: **default posture is NO patent filings at pre-revenue stage due to Alice/Mayo § 101 prosecution risk; revisit at $5M ARR or when a true novel-method emerges.** Software algorithmic surfaces (keyboard routers, import-pipeline orchestrators, free-tier-cap enforcement) face Alice/Mayo § 101 abstract-idea rejection at high rates; prosecution cost ($10k-$50k per application) is not justified at pre-revenue scale. Hardware / biotech / true novel-method products carry distinct patent posture — those get a row in § Open Decisions, not the default-skip line. Patent posture omission is the CUT this paragraph fixes — "silent on patents" is the regression mode.
   - **IP Assignment posture.** Two artifacts the founder MUST execute (and v1 typically defers documentation of):
     - **Founder IP Assignment Agreement** — at entity formation, assigning all founder work-product (pre-incorporation code, designs, brand assets) to the company. Required for Series A IP-chain-of-title diligence; investors reject any unassigned-founder exposure.
     - **PIIA (Proprietary Information and Inventions Assignment Agreement) for contractors and employees** — executed BEFORE first commit / first day, assigning work-product to the company and covering perpetual license + confidentiality. The roadmap's part-time designer / first-engineer-hire is the standard trigger. Retroactive PIIA is unenforceable in many jurisdictions.
     
     Both surface as explicit § Open Decisions rows with concrete deciding signals (Founder IPAA: "at entity formation, before any Company code is committed"; PIIA: "before the designer's first commit / first employee's first day") and `[counsel-review] [founder]` concern tags — NOT buried under § Regulated Aspects § Trade-secret as a sub-paragraph.

6. **Regulated Aspects** — the regulation triggers + posture per trigger. Conditional rows fire only when the trigger applies. Format:
   - **HIPAA** (when health data — PHI as defined under 45 CFR 160.103). Posture: covered-entity vs business-associate vs neither (most B2B SaaS that touches health data is BA; the customer is the CE). BAA mandatory. Encryption requirements stricter than baseline (FIPS 140-2 compliant).
   - **COPPA** (when minors under 13 are users — even if not the target audience, if minors are reasonably foreseeable). Posture: age-gate before account creation; verifiable parental consent for under-13 data collection; safe-harbor program (TRUSTe, iKeepSafe) opt-in.
   - **PCI DSS** (when payment-card data flows through the product). Posture: SAQ-A (Stripe-hosted redirect — minimal PCI scope; the default) vs SAQ-A-EP (tokenized iframe — moderate scope) vs SAQ-D (full card data — maximum scope, avoid for v1). Cite system-design § Integrations § Stripe for the integration mode.
   - **SOC 2** (when enterprise customers will require it — usually a Series A milestone, not v1). Posture: Type I readiness in v1 (controls documented + 6-month observation window starts); Type II at scale (audit fires after 6 months of evidence). Cost line in step-10 § Run Cost.
   - **GLBA** (when consumer financial data is collected — fintech). Posture: privacy notice mandatory; safeguards rule applies.
   - **FERPA** (when education records — student data). Posture: directory-information vs sensitive-record split; parental access rights.
   - **AI Act (EU)** (when AI is in the stack AND EU users are reached). Posture: high-risk AI system classification (most B2B SaaS LLM features are *limited-risk* under Art 52 — transparency obligations only; biometric / employment / education / law-enforcement use cases jump to *high-risk* with full conformity assessment). Article applicability begins August 2026.
   - **State employment privacy laws** (when employee data is collected — Illinois BIPA for biometrics, California CCPA for employee records since 2023, NY 2023 employment regulations).
   - **Trade-secret protection** (when proprietary algorithms / customer lists / pricing are material). Posture: NDAs with contractors signed BEFORE access; access controls; explicit confidentiality marking. Public disclosure (open-source release, conference talk, blog post) destroys trade-secret status — flag if any pre-launch disclosure happened.
   - **Trademark posture** (when brand name is material — most consumer-facing products). Posture: clearance search before launch (USPTO TESS + EU EUIPO eSearch); strength analysis (generic / descriptive / suggestive / fanciful — fanciful is strongest); filing strategy (USPTO + EUIPO Madrid System for international).

   Each row carries a posture sentence + a counsel-review trigger ("Outside counsel signs off on HIPAA BAA template via 1-line email before first health-data-flowing feature ships").

7. **AI-Specific** (conditional — fires only when AI-in-stack signal from § 2 is yes). Format:
   - **Training-data provenance.** What data the model was trained on (model vendor's training set; internal fine-tuning on customer data — the latter requires explicit consent and DPA carve-out). If the company fine-tunes on customer data, name the opt-in mechanism.
   - **Model-output liability.** Disclaimers in the ToS: outputs are AI-generated, may be inaccurate, must not be relied upon for medical / legal / financial decisions without independent verification. The disclaimer goes in the actual ToS; the posture lives here.
   - **User disclosure of AI involvement.** Visible in-product labeling when output is AI-generated (legally mandatory in some jurisdictions starting 2026 — California AB 2013, EU AI Act Art 52). Posture: in-product badge + ToS disclosure.
   - **Opt-out from model improvement.** Does the company use customer data to improve the model? If yes, named opt-out mechanism (settings toggle + DPA carve-out for enterprise). Default for B2B SaaS: opt-out by default; data NEVER used for model improvement without explicit opt-in.
   - **Vendor sub-processor disclosure.** OpenAI / Anthropic / Cohere / Mistral as sub-processors — DPA reference + cross-border transfer mechanism (most are US-resident; SCCs Module 2 applies for EU data).
   - **Output filtering posture.** Content moderation on outputs (PII redaction, harmful-content filtering). Cite the actual implementation in system-design § Integrations.

8. **Open Decisions — single consolidated table covering corporate + privacy + IP rows.** The legal-posture decisions the founder hasn't made yet that the document is parked on. Each row carries a deciding signal. Mirrors step-9 / 10 / 11 § Open Decisions discipline. **One unified table, NOT per-sub-section tables** — corporate (entity formation, ToS cap), privacy (DSAR runbook, EU residency, DPIA scope), and IP (license choice, transitive-dep audit, PIIA execution, Founder IPAA, patent posture re-evaluation) rows all live in this single § Open Decisions table. Per-sub-section sub-tables are the anti-pattern; consolidated is the discipline. Format:
   ```markdown
   | # | Decision | Default if no decision by | Deciding signal | Concern |
   |---|---|---|---|---|
   | 1 | Apache 2.0 vs MIT for the product's own license | end of week 4 (start of Polish phase) | Patent-grant concern: if v1 ships novel algorithms, Apache 2.0's explicit patent grant prevents downstream patent litigation; MIT silent on patents | [founder] [counsel-review] |
   | 2 | EU region deployment in v1 vs v2 | end of week 8 (mid Killer Flow) | First EU customer signs LOI or first design partner is EU-based; flip to v1 if either triggers | [founder] [engineering] |
   | 3 | DPIA scope — is OpenAI integration "large-scale automated decision-making" under GDPR Art 35? | end of week 6 (before Killer Flow demos to design partners) | If killer-flow uses LLM output to drive user-facing classification (issue triage, content moderation), DPIA fires; counsel confirms | [counsel-review] [product] |
   | 4 | Transitive-dependency audit via `license-checker` / `licensee` / `cargo-license` | end of polish phase / before public launch | Run `npx license-checker --excludePrivatePackages --onlyAllow 'MIT;Apache-2.0;BSD-2-Clause;BSD-3-Clause;ISC;MPL-2.0;PostgreSQL'` (or stack-equivalent); fail-build CI gate added; flag any AGPL/GPL/LGPL/SSPL hit as `Critical — network copyleft triggered` | [engineering] [counsel-review] |
   | 5 | Founder IP Assignment Agreement execution | at entity formation, before any Company code is committed | Delaware Certificate of Incorporation filed → counsel supplies template → founder executes → file in cap-table records | [founder] [counsel-review] |
   | 6 | Contractor PIIA template execution | before the first contractor's / part-time hire's first commit | Roadmap names a part-time designer or first-engineer hire — execute PIIA before that person merges any code | [founder] [counsel-review] |
   | 7 | Patent posture re-evaluation | $5M ARR OR first genuinely-novel algorithmic differentiation surfaces | Default v1 posture is no filings (Alice/Mayo § 101 prosecution risk); re-evaluate at the revenue / novelty signal | [founder] [counsel-review] |
   ```
   4-8 rows is the target for a B2B SaaS at v1 (was previously 2-4 — the IP-assignment + transitive-audit + patent-posture rows added by the step-12 calibration push the floor up by ~3 rows). Concern tags use the step-11 allow-list extended with `[counsel-review]` for legal-discipline rows.

   **§ Risks consolidation rule mirrors § Open Decisions.** When the posture document includes a § Risks table (probability × impact × mitigation), it is ALSO a single consolidated table covering corporate (entity-formation gap, ToS cap rejected), privacy (DSAR-SLA-breach, breach-notification-SOP-gap, controller-vs-processor audit fail), and IP (transitive AGPL surfaces, trademark conflict, unassigned-contractor IP) rows. Per-discipline sub-risk-tables are the anti-pattern.

### 5. Calibrate by product class (smart, not rigid)

Mirrors step-9 / 10 / 11 calibration ladder. **Posture depth + section emphasis scale with product class:**

| Product class | legal-posture.md depth | Sections of emphasis | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Micro-Product / CLI helper / dev-tool with no auth** | Compact ~6 KB | Terms + Licensing only; § Privacy degenerates (no PII collected) | When the product collects ZERO PII, § Privacy + § Data Handling + § Sub-Processors collapse to single line each: `*No PII collected; section degenerates*`. § Licensing becomes the dominant section. |
| **Consumer Mobile App (1 persona, B2C)** | Standard ~9 KB | Privacy (CCPA + COPPA loudly; GDPR if global) + Data Handling | App-store-policy compliance is implicit (Apple ATT, Google Play Data Safety) — name as a § Regulated Aspects row. § Terms emphasises clickwrap-at-signup. |
| **B2B SaaS (the default)** | Full ~9-11 KB | Privacy + Data Handling + Sub-Processors + Regulated Aspects (SOC 2 prep) | DPA mandatory for enterprise customers; controller-vs-processor split is the dominant framing. SCCs for EU data flows. § Open Decisions usually carries SOC 2 timing + EU residency decisions. |
| **Developer Tool / API-first** | Standard ~8 KB | Licensing (OSS license choice is dominant) + Terms (API ToS) | If SDK is published, OSS license rationale section expands. § Sub-Processors light unless the tool transits customer data through hosted infra. |
| **AI-stack (LLM in production data flow)** | Expanded ~11-13 KB | + § AI-Specific fires + AI Act row in § Regulated Aspects | All of B2B SaaS depth PLUS the AI-specific section. Training-data + opt-out + output filtering posture mandatory. AI Act applicability triggers in Aug 2026 — name it. |
| **Regulated Vertical (health / fintech / education / employment)** | Expanded ~12-15 KB | + dedicated row per applicable regime in § Regulated Aspects + BAA/SAQ-A/FERPA-DPA-shape posture | HIPAA / GLBA / FERPA / BIPA each get their own posture row. § Privacy controller-vs-processor matters even more — health-data BA model under HIPAA is distinct from GDPR controller-vs-processor framing. |

Signal extraction ambiguous → default to **B2B SaaS Full (9-11 KB)**. Mark the chosen class in § Overview opening sentence (`v1 legal posture for a B2B SaaS with AI-stack — 11-section full template applied (AI-Specific fires).`).

Product classes overlap. A B2B SaaS for EU healthcare clinics with AI-driven triage is **B2B SaaS + AI-stack + Regulated Vertical (HIPAA + GDPR + AI Act)** — depth expands to ~14 KB and § Regulated Aspects carries 4-5 rows. Calibration is *additive* across overlapping classes, not exclusive.

### 6. Concern tags (inherited from step-11)

Deliverable / decision rows MAY carry a bracketed cross-functional concern tag. Step-11's allow-list extended with `[counsel-review]`:

- `[engineering]` / `[product+engineering]` / `[product]` / `[design]` / `[founder]` — step-11 allow-list
- `[counsel-review]` — NEW for step 12. Signals that the row requires outside counsel sign-off before the posture commits. Examples: BAA template approval, AGPL component removal sign-off, DPIA scope confirmation.

Tags are OPTIONAL — omit when single-discipline. Don't invent new tags.

### 7. Real-human acceptance discipline (inherited from step-11)

At least one row per major section SHOULD anchor to a real human role — "Outside counsel signs off on HIPAA BAA template via 1-line email confirmation before first health-data feature ships" / "DPO reviews § Privacy Posture and signs off via written confirmation before launch" / "Founder confirms § Regulated Aspects § AI Act posture against the most-recent EU AI Act guidance with outside counsel". CI-only / artifact-presence checks are necessary-but-not-sufficient; a named human signoff is the contract.

### 8. Step-4 finding-ID lineage (inherited from step-11)

The § Privacy Posture data-categories table MAY cite step-4 (validation) finding IDs in a `Source` column when the row resolves a finding — e.g. a clarity-of-consent UI finding from step 4 (`F-08: users didn't understand the consent dialog; recommended explicit purpose breakdown`) traces forward to the § Privacy Posture row that names per-purpose consent. Citation shape: `step 4 § Findings § F-08 resolved`. Opportunistic — skip when no step-4 finding applies.

### 9. Submit + gate

Call `product_step_submit` with:
- `step: 12`
- `filename: "legal-posture.md"`
- `content: <full posture>`

No `extra_files` — single-artifact step.

Schema enforces section presence + Layer 1 contains/size floors (literal H2 anchors + at least 2 markdown-table-header literals + the `[counsel-review]` concern-tag literal as the calibration anchor). On success, `product_advance` returns `code: "gate-required", phase: "specification"` (because `GATE_AFTER` in `src/pipeline.ts` includes 12). Parent asks the user to confirm Specification phase is ready to close, calls `product_gate_pass("specification")`, then `product_advance` again to enter step 13 (prototype-v3 — the visual contract).

**Step 12 is NOT the final step.** Step 13 (prototype-v3) closes the pipeline. Per `src/pipeline.ts` § comment: "Step 13 (prototype-v3) does NOT close a phase — it's the in-phase final deliverable of specification. product_advance after step 13 fires product_done (pipeline-complete) and surfaces the /sdd handoff." Step 12 closes the gate; step 13 closes the pipeline.

## Voice & rigor

- **The escape clause is at the TOP, not the bottom.** Visibility matters. A founder reading this document with their attention waning at section 6 must STILL have seen the "not legal advice" framing.
- **This artifact briefs counsel — it does not replace counsel.** Write it in a way a non-lawyer founder can hand to their lawyer for a productive 30-minute conversation. The lawyer drafts the actual ToS / Privacy Policy / DPA / regulated-aspect filings. The posture document surfaces decisions; the artifacts execute them.
- **Cite the system-design integrations explicitly.** "Stripe (system-design § Integrations § Payments) — Stripe's published DPA applies; PCI scope reduced to SAQ-A via redirect/tokenization model." NOT "we use Stripe for payments". The citation is the audit trail; without it the row is unanchored.
- **Regulated-aspect callouts are mandatory if any apply.** Don't bury them. "This product collects health data (PRD § Users — fitness coaching with biometric heart-rate input) — HIPAA may apply; counsel must confirm whether covered-entity vs business-associate model fits BEFORE first health-data feature ships." The row exists OR doesn't — silent omission is the regression mode the discipline catches.
- **Open-source license choice is deliberate, with rationale.** MIT / Apache 2.0 / AGPL each have downstream consequences; pick with reasoning, NOT by default. "Apache 2.0 because v1 ships a novel ranking algorithm; the explicit patent grant prevents downstream patent litigation against the company and against contributors." Without the rationale, the license is decorative — and license choice has 10-year consequences.
- **AGPL components in SaaS stacks are the load-bearing OSS risk.** AGPL's network copyleft is triggered by SaaS delivery — any AGPL component requires source disclosure OR a commercial license. Flag at § Licensing § OSS components with `Critical — network copyleft triggered`.
- **Controller-vs-processor declaration is per-flow, not per-product.** A B2B SaaS is *controller* for first-party data the user provides (account email, billing address) AND *processor* for second-party data the customer's end-users generate (workspace content, customer-end-user usage events). Declare per data flow. The "we're both" ambiguity is the GDPR Art 28 audit failure mode.
- **Consent is not the default legal basis.** The dominant privacy anti-pattern. Evaluate per processing activity — Contract (Art 6(1)(b)) covers most account / billing flows; Legitimate Interest (Art 6(1)(f)) covers most analytics; Consent is the basis for marketing email + tracking cookies only.
- **Sub-processor disclosure is exhaustive, not vague.** GDPR Art 28(2) requires controller's prior authorization for EACH sub-processor. "We use various third-party services" fails; "Stripe (payments), OpenAI (LLM features for issue summarization), Auth0 (authentication), Sentry (error monitoring), PostHog (product analytics), Resend (transactional email), Vercel + Neon (hosting + database)" passes.
- **DPIA trigger is binary, not aspirational.** When systematic monitoring OR sensitive data at scale OR automated decision-making OR large-scale profiling fires, DPIA is MANDATORY *before processing commences* (GDPR Art 35). NOT "we'll do a DPIA when we have time". Mark `[DPIA Required]` inline; flag in § Open Decisions if not yet completed; pause feature ship if blocked.
- **AI Act applicability begins August 2026.** Most B2B SaaS LLM features are *limited-risk* under Art 52 — transparency obligations only (user disclosure that AI is generating output). High-risk use cases (biometric, employment scoring, education scoring, law enforcement) jump to full conformity assessment — name them explicitly if relevant.
- **No meta-commentary section about the document's own legal discipline.** Do NOT write a `## Notes on this posture's compliance discipline` or any equivalent. The matrix tables + posture rows + open decisions ARE the discipline; a section *about* them is noise. (Inherits step-9 / 10 / 11 CUT-2.)
- **No "locked decisions" sub-section.** Product class, jurisdiction exposure, AI-stack signal are declared inline in § Overview opening. Re-tabling them as a separate Locked H2 duplicates the running commitment. (Inherits step-9 / 10 / 11 CUT-1.)
- **No metadata banner with pipe-separators at top of file.** Do NOT emit a header line in the shape `**Pipeline step:** 12 (Legal) | **Generated:** YYYY-MM-DD | **Class:** B2B SaaS + AI-stack`. Ceremony with no payoff — file path + § Overview opening sentence carry the same signal. (Inherits step-11 CUT-3.)
- **The document is a posture briefing, NOT stapled drafts of ToS / Privacy / DPA / IP-analysis.** A founder hands this to outside counsel for a 30-minute conversation; the lawyer produces the actual artifacts. Sweet-spot file size is 11-14 KB for a standard B2B SaaS posture (expand to ~14 KB for B2B SaaS + AI-stack + Regulated Vertical overlap). A 30+ KB output is the regression mode where the agent slipped into drafting actual recitals / clauses / DPA terms — counsel-territory work that the escape clause at the TOP exists to prevent. Density discipline: prefer markdown tables, sub-bulleted lists, and one-line posture sentences over multi-paragraph narrative; the dense table substrate (regulation matrix + sub-processor table + OSS components + GDPR article-grid + Open Decisions + Risks) is the load-bearing shape.
- **Patent posture is explicit, not silent.** Default for software-only v1 stacks is no filings (Alice/Mayo § 101 risk). Hardware / biotech / true novel-method products carry distinct posture — those get a § Open Decisions row, not the default-skip line. Silence on patents is the CUT this rule fixes — counsel needs to see the posture even when the posture is "no filings".
- **PIIA + Founder IPAA are explicit § Open Decisions rows, not buried.** Two artifacts the founder MUST execute (Founder IPAA at entity formation; Contractor PIIA before first commit). Surfacing them as dedicated rows with deciding signals (NOT as a sub-paragraph under § Regulated Aspects § Trade-secret) is the discipline. Investors diligence IP chain of title at Series A — unassigned-contractor exposure is a deal-killer; deferring documentation past the trigger event is the regression mode.
- **Sub-processor jurisdiction = `architecture.json` sublabel OR cost-estimate § Run Cost source, NOT vendor HQ.** PostHog `"cloud, EU region"` (per architecture.json sublabel) is the correct cross-border posture; "UK" because Posthog Inc.'s HQ is in the UK is the regression. Regional deployment, not corporate domicile, drives the cross-border mechanism column.
- **Sub-processor count locks to cost-estimate § Run Cost vendor count.** 10-vendor cost-estimate → 10-row sub-processor table; 6-vendor → 6-row. Validator does NOT enforce; agent discipline catches mismatches as either Art 28(2) gaps (missing vendor) or ghost vendors (referenced without a cost line).
- **DSAR windows are per-regulation, not blanket.** GDPR Art 12: 30 days (extendable +60); LGPD Art 19: 15 days; CCPA / CPRA: 45 days (+45); PIPEDA: 30 days. Default to the strictest applicable window. Blanket "30-day SLA" under-serves LGPD subjects.
- **Open Decisions carry deciding signals.** Every deferred legal decision either HOLDS or FLIPS on a measurable signal — a first-EU-customer LOI, a counsel sign-off email, a regulatory-deadline date. Mirrors step-9 / 10 / 11 § Open Decisions discipline.
- **Exit / sub-criteria with ≥4 conditions format as sub-bulleted list, not single paragraph.** Inherits step-11's wall-of-text CUT. When § Regulated Aspects § HIPAA row carries 4+ posture conditions (covered-entity-status / BAA-required / encryption-standard / breach-notification-SLA / training-mandate), format as sub-bullets under the row, NOT a single paragraph.
- **Cross-references trace to source.** Privacy row cites `system-design § Data Model § PIIFields`; sub-processor row cites `system-design § Integrations § Stripe`; OSS-component row cites the actual `package.json` / `Cargo.toml` / `requirements.txt` path. Without source citations, the posture is decorative.

## What this step does NOT do

- **Draft actual ToS / Privacy Policy / DPA.** Those are lawyer artifacts produced after the founder briefs counsel using this document. The posture is the BRIEFING.
- **Tax / corporate-entity decisions.** Delaware C-Corp vs Cayman vs UK Ltd is a corporate-counsel decision distinct from product-legal posture. Different professional, different category.
- **Cap-table modeling, equity grants, board resolutions.** This step ports the *terms / privacy / IP* surface only. Corporate governance is a separate concern handled outside this pipeline.
- **Trademark clearance search execution.** The posture names the trademark concern + recommends the search; the actual search is a USPTO TESS / EUIPO eSearch + counsel review (or a paid clearance service).
- **Patent prosecution / FTO analysis.** Posture names the IP-assignment-from-contractors gap + the patentability vs FTO distinction; the actual analysis is a patent attorney's deliverable.
- **Employment-agreement drafting.** PIIA + offer letters + invention assignment for employees are corporate-counsel artifacts.
- **SOC 2 audit execution.** Posture names SOC 2 readiness timing + cost (step-10 § Run Cost); the actual audit is a 6-month observation window with a third-party auditor (Deloitte / Vanta-mediated / etc).
- **Live legal advice.** The founder reads this and books a 30-minute counsel call. The document does not substitute for the call.

## Design notes

This step unifies three legal disciplines into one synthesis posture document — corporate-counsel scope (terms of service, jurisdiction awareness, entity-type awareness), privacy-DPO scope (regulation matrix GDPR / LGPD / CCPA / PIPEDA / COPPA, controller-vs-processor framing, data-categories table with retention, sub-processor disclosure, DPIA trigger, 72-hour breach notification, matrix mode), and IP-counsel scope (OSS license compatibility matrix MIT / Apache 2.0 / LGPL / GPL / AGPL with SaaS implications, trade-secret protection, trademark clearance, patent FTO vs patentability, AGPL network-copyleft warning). The load-bearing disciplines (counsel-review checkpoint, regulation matrix shape, sub-processor exhaustiveness, AGPL warning, controller-vs-processor per-flow declaration) and their anti-patterns catalog are preserved intact.

Six calibration choices worth naming:

1. **Synthesis posture document, NOT corporate-document drafting.** This step produces a SYNTHESIS POSTURE document — a founder-facing inventory of "here's where v1 lands on each legal axis; outside counsel writes the actual artifacts" — NOT actual legal documents with WHEREAS / NOW-THEREFORE recitals, full DPAs with Article 28 clauses, or detailed claim-mapping IP analyses. Removes the "founder uses an AI-drafted board resolution unchecked" failure mode that ambitious legal-document templates structurally invite. The escape clause at the TOP makes the boundary explicit.

2. **Three-scope unification with conditional-section calibration.** ONE template with product-class-driven section emphasis: § Privacy fires loud for consumer + B2B SaaS; § Licensing fires loud for dev-tools + open-source; § Regulated Aspects fires only when triggers detect; § AI-Specific fires only when AI-in-stack signal is yes. The prior-artifact signals drive the routing. Closes the "one-mode template" audit-smell.

3. **Product-class calibration ladder.** Posture depth calibrates by product class — Micro 6 KB, Consumer Mobile 9 KB, B2B SaaS Full 9-11 KB, AI-stack 11-13 KB, Regulated Vertical 12-15 KB. Closes the "undynamic defaults" audit-smell. Classes overlap additively — a B2B SaaS + AI-stack + Healthcare regime expands to ~14 KB with 4 § Regulated Aspects rows.

4. **No magic-number floors.** Section coverage is driven by signal-extraction (jurisdiction exposure + AI-in-stack signal + product class), NOT magic minimums like "scope lists more than 5 requirements" or "at least 2 risks per phase". Every applicable regulation has a posture row, with NO minimum count — coverage is driven by trigger, not by floor.

5. **Sub-agent synthesis, NOT live interview.** `delegable: true` — fully delegable; the sub-agent reads prior artifacts and synthesizes the posture document with NO live parent interview. The 4 signals (product class / jurisdiction / sub-processor stack / AI-in-stack) are mechanically extracted from prior artifacts. Mirrors step-9 system-design's synthesis posture (in contrast to step-10 / step-11's `delegable: partial` with parent-only interview inputs). Closes the "single-orchestrator" audit-smell.

6. **§ Open Decisions with deciding signals + concern tags (mirrors step-9 / 10 / 11).** `## Open Decisions` carries decisions WITH a deciding signal that closes the deferral. Concern tags inherit the step-11 allow-list extended with `[counsel-review]` for legal-discipline rows.

The halt-protocol translates to the MCP's `product_step_submit` validation error semantics (`{code: "schema-incomplete", missing_or_invalid: [...]}`). The 72-hour breach notification + DPIA trigger discipline + AGPL warning + controller-vs-processor framing are inherited intact — those are load-bearing.

### Calibration revisions applied (2026-05-16)

Six disciplines from blind judge feedback on the step-12 dogfood are absorbed as KEEPs; four anti-patterns are cut as CUTs. The KEEPs and CUTs unify — each CUT is fixed by one or more KEEPs (mirrors step-10 / step-11 commit-body convention):

1. **KEEP — Transitive-dependency-tree IP risk acknowledged** (fixes CUT 3: framework-level-only OSS inventory). The § Licensing § OSS component table treats framework-level inventory (Next.js, React, Prisma, …) as necessary but not sufficient — the actual `package-lock.json` / `Cargo.lock` reality is 600-1500 transitive deps; a single AGPL transitive is the dominant probabilistic risk. The transitive audit (via `license-checker` / `cargo-license` / `pip-licenses` / `go-licenses`) becomes a § Open Decisions row with deciding signal = end of polish phase / before public launch. Documented in § 4 step 5 (Licensing) + `references/oss-license-matrix.md` § Transitive-dependency posture.

2. **KEEP — PIIA + Founder IP Assignment Agreement as dedicated § Open Decisions rows** (fixes CUT 2: implicit PIIA workstream). The two IP-assignment artifacts (Founder IPAA at entity formation; Contractor PIIA before first commit) surface as explicit numbered § Open Decisions rows with concrete deciding signals and `[counsel-review] [founder]` concern tags, NOT buried under § Regulated Aspects § Trade-secret as a sub-paragraph. Documented in § 4 step 5 (Licensing) + § 4 step 8 (Open Decisions).

3. **KEEP — GDPR article-grid matrix as a reusable audit substrate.** When GDPR applies AND the product is non-trivial, the § Privacy Posture includes a sub-section table covering Articles 5/6/7/8/12/13/14/15-22/24/25/28/30/32/33/34/35/37/44-49 with `Applicable / Control / Evidence-location` columns. The fillable template lives in `references/privacy-matrix-shape.md` § GDPR article-grid; the agent populates with project-specific entries. Documented in § 4 step 3 (Privacy Posture).

4. **KEEP — DSAR-window-per-regulation precision.** GDPR Art 12: 30 days (extendable +60); LGPD Art 19: 15 days; CCPA / CPRA § 1798.130: 45 days (extendable +45); PIPEDA: 30 days. Default to the strictest applicable window when multiple regulations apply (typically LGPD's 15 days). Blanket "30-day SLA" is the regression mode — under-serves LGPD subjects. Documented in § 4 step 3 (Privacy Posture) + `references/privacy-matrix-shape.md` § DSAR-window-per-regulation.

5. **KEEP — Patent posture explicit negative** (fixes CUT 1: patent-posture silence). The § Licensing section now carries a default posture line for software-only v1 stacks: **no patent filings at pre-revenue stage due to Alice/Mayo § 101 prosecution risk; revisit at $5M ARR or when a true novel-method emerges.** Patent posture omission is the regression mode the line catches. Documented in § 4 step 5 (Licensing) + `references/oss-license-matrix.md` § Patent strategy.

6. **KEEP — Architecture.json sublabel-aware sub-processor jurisdiction precision** (fixes CUT 4: PostHog jurisdiction = "UK" by vendor HQ). § Data Handling § Sub-processor disclosure cross-border-mechanism column derives jurisdiction from `architecture.json` sub-component sublabel (e.g. PostHog `"cloud, EU region"`) OR cost-estimate § Run Cost source citation, NOT vendor HQ. Listing PostHog as "UK" because Posthog Inc.'s HQ is in the UK when the architecture.json declares EU-Cloud regionalization is the regression. Documented in § 4 step 4 (Data Handling).

Two meta-calibrations from the verdict's 200-word synthesis are also absorbed:

- **Consolidated tables (§ Open Decisions + § Risks) covering corporate + privacy + IP rows in ONE table each, NOT per-section sub-tables.** Documented in § 4 step 8 (Open Decisions). The MCP template already did this implicitly; the calibration makes the rule explicit and adds the § Risks parallel.
- **Sub-processor row-lock to cost-estimate § Run Cost vendor count** — a 10-vendor cost-estimate produces a 10-row sub-processor table. Validator does NOT enforce; the discipline is on the agent. Documented in § 4 step 4 (Data Handling).

Step-9 + step-10 + step-11 prior calibration anti-patterns are preserved unchanged: § Voice & rigor still carries "no meta-commentary section", "no Locked Decisions sub-section", "no metadata banner with pipe-separators at top of file", and "wall-of-text exit-criteria → sub-bulleted list when ≥4 conditions" (the CUTs from prior step calibrations).
