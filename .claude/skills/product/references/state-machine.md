# State machine — `/product` v0.4.0 (`.state.json` v5)

Defines `.state.json` shape, phase/step progression, gate semantics, and resume support via `--from-step=NN`. Current shape is v5 (v0.4.0). v2 / v3 / v4 shapes are preserved for compatibility detection (orchestrator aborts cleanly when an older state file is found, rather than silently corrupting it).

## `.state.json` shape (v5)

Written at `<out-dir>/docs/.state.json`. Initialized by Phase 0, updated at each step boundary, finalized at Phase 5 close.

Field semantics:

- **`version`** — schema version of `.state.json` itself. Current: `5`. Increments when a resume across the change would **mis-orchestrate** — a behavioral phase/step break, or a non-back-compatible field change. A purely additive field that an older reader can ignore and a newer reader can treat as absent does NOT bump: `quality_verdicts` was added and the schema stayed v5, because the resume gate trusts `completed_steps`, never the verdicts, so there is no mis-orchestration risk. The version-history below records past bumps — each was a mis-orchestration break, not a mere field touch.
  - v1 — single `phase` int 0-5, no step tracking.
  - v2 — 13-step tracking, `phase` int 0-5, `iterations` keyed by `discovery`/`identity`/`specification`.
  - v3 — 15-step tracking, `phase` string enum, NN-flat artifact paths under `docs/`.
  - v4 — same 15-step pipeline as v3; artifact paths refactored to semantic-named (no `NN-` prefix); PRD release-scoped via `docs/prd/v1.md`; design system grouped at `docs/design-system/`.
  - v5 — same 15-step pipeline; Phase 4 reshaped (no per-route screen-writer fan-out — Step 15 is atlas + hi-fi mood + fixture-spec); Phase 5 is now the mandatory SDD handoff; `phase` enum gains `sdd-handoff`. The v4→v5 break is behavioral (Phase 4/5 produce different artifacts), not a field-shape change — but resume across the break would mis-orchestrate, so v4 is refused.
- **`slug`** — kebab-case product slug derived from `idea`. Computed once at Phase 0; immutable thereafter.
- **`idea`** — verbatim user input from `/product "<idea>"`. Immutable.
- **`flags`** — captured from invocation; `out` is required, others default. Immutable post-Phase 0 except `from_step` (cleared after resume completes).
- **`phase`** — current phase as string enum. One of `discovery | specification | identity | visual-contract | sdd-handoff`. Updated at phase boundary. `sdd-handoff` is Phase 5 — set when the run scaffolds the umbrella + foundation child; `step` stays `15` through it (Phase 5 has no step number).
- **`step`** — current step number, int 1-15 (or 0 during Phase 0 setup). Stays `15` during Phase 5.
- **`step_label`** — human-readable step name matching bundled template dir name (e.g. `09-legal`, `12-gtm-launch`, `15-screen-atlas`).
- **`started_at`** — UTC ISO-8601 timestamp from Phase 0.
- **`gates_passed`** — list of phase names with `continue` choice at gate. Order matters (cannot be in `specification` if `discovery` not first). Valid values: `discovery`, `specification`, `identity`.
- **`completed_steps`** — list of step labels that finished cleanly. Append-only.
- **`blocked_steps`** — list of objects `{step_label, reason, artifacts_partial?}` for steps that returned BLOCKED. Empty list when no blocks.
- **`iterations`** — count of `iterate` gate-pass choices per phase. Each `iterate` increments; `continue` does not. Used to cap runaway iteration (soft cap = 3 per phase; warn at 3, soft-abort at 5).
- **`quality_verdicts`** — map keyed by judge-unit label (`01-ideation` … `15c-fixture-spec`) → the quality judge's verdict object for that step. Each verdict carries `step` / `judged_at` / `model` / `criteria[]` (per-criterion `pass`/`concern`/`fail` + one-line `note`) / `scope_assessment` / `outcome` (the max-severity rollup `fail` > `concern` > `pass`). A map, not a list — a re-judged step (gate `iterate`) overwrites its key; a missing key = not yet judged. Initialized `{}` by Phase 0. **Additive in v5** — see `version` above. Full verdict shape + the verdict→gate routing: `quality-judge.md`.
- **`completed_at`** — UTC ISO-8601 set when Phase 5 (the SDD handoff) closes successfully. Null otherwise.

## Phase progression (v5)

```
Phase 0 (setup) → step 0
  ↓
Phase 1 (discovery) → steps 01-04
  steps 01 (blocking, opus) → 02 alone → 03 alone → 04 alone
    (Steps 03 and 04 are NOT parallel — Step 04 reads functional-spec.md,
     Step 03's deliverable)
  ↓
  gate_discovery [AskUserQuestion: continue / iterate / abort]
    continue → Phase 2
    iterate  → re-dispatch failing step(s) within Phase 1, then re-gate
    abort    → exit; .state.json preserved for later resume
  ↓
Phase 2 (specification) → steps 05-12
  steps 05 (blocking, PRD) → 06+07 parallel (OST + sitemap-IA)
    → schema enforcement on docs/sitemap.yaml (BLOCK if required_categories not covered)
    → 08 (system-design + data-flow) → 09 (legal + DPIA from data-flow)
    → 10 (roadmap defines phases) → 11+12 parallel (cost + GTM)
  ↓
  gate_specification [AskUserQuestion: continue / iterate / abort]
  ↓
Phase 3 (identity) → steps 13-14
  steps 13 (brand) → 14 (design-system, depends on brand) — strict serial
  ↓
  gate_identity [AskUserQuestion: continue / iterate / abort]
  ↓
Phase 4 (visual-contract) → step 15 (two waves)
  wave A: 15a atlas-writer + 15c fixture-spec writer
    — dispatched in parallel (one message); no shared input, distinct outputs
  wave B: 15b hi-fi mood-writers (cap=5) — after 15c returns
    — hi-fi Mood-screen-writer reads fixture-spec.md (15c's deliverable),
      so 15b CANNOT share a message with 15c
  NO per-route fan-out, NO app/ tree, NO build verification
  + best-effort Playwright visual check + author REPORT.md
  ↓
Phase 5 (sdd-handoff)
  scaffold docs/specs/001-<slug>/ (umbrella) + docs/specs/002-foundation/ (child #1)
  print handoff message
  ↓
  completed_at set
```

**Quality judge.** After each phase's steps complete — and before the phase gate — the orchestrator runs the quality judge over that phase's steps (`SKILL.md § Quality judge`). Verdicts land in `.state.json` `quality_verdicts`. A `fail` verdict pre-sets the phase gate's recommended option to `iterate`; Phase 4 (no gate) surfaces a `fail` in the terminal handoff + `REPORT.md § Quality concerns`. The judge never autonomously BLOCKs or aborts — see `quality-judge.md`.

Phase 0 has no gate (idempotency check is local). Phase 4 + Phase 5 have no gate (Phase 5's SDD-spec scaffold is the terminal handoff). Note phase ORDER vs v2: Specification (was Phase 3 in v2) is Phase 2 (PRD-first); Identity (was Phase 2) is Phase 3.

## Step ordering within Phase 2 — Specification (most complex)

Phase 2's 8 steps follow a DAG (not strictly serial, not fully parallel):

```
05 PRD (blocking)
  ├──────► 06 OST   ┐
  └──────► 07 sitemap-IA   ┘ ──► 08 system-design ──► 09 legal
                                       │                  │
                                       ▼                  ▼
                                  10 roadmap     11 cost + 12 GTM (parallel)
```

Dispatch sequence (orchestrator follows literally):
1. Step 05 alone (blocking; downstream depends on US-NN)
2. Steps 06+07 parallel (both consume Step 05's PRD)
3. **Step 07 schema enforcement check** (orchestrator parses sitemap.yaml; BLOCK Step 07 + re-dispatch if `required_categories` not covered without `deferred_categories` declaration)
4. Step 08 alone (needs Step 07 sitemap routes for system-design integration list)
5. Step 09 alone (needs Step 08 data-flow inventory for DPIA trigger)
6. Step 10 alone (defines phases for cost calculation)
7. Steps 11+12 parallel (cost reads Step 09 legal budget + Step 10 roadmap; GTM reads Step 09 + Step 10)

## Gate UX

At end of Phase 1, 2, 3:

1. Skill prints a per-phase summary: artifacts produced (file paths + sizes), blocked steps if any, iteration count if any.
2. Skill invokes `AskUserQuestion` with 3 options:
   - **`continue`** → next phase. Appends phase name to `gates_passed`.
   - **`iterate`** → user names which step(s) to re-dispatch (sub-prompt). Re-dispatches with augmented brief. Increments `iterations.<phase>` counter. Re-prompts gate after re-dispatch.
   - **`abort`** → exit cleanly. Sets `flags.from_step` = current step for resume hint. Prints `Run /product "<idea>" --from-step=<NN> --out=<same-path>` to resume.

**Quality-judge pre-set:** if any of the phase's `quality_verdicts` has `outcome: "fail"`, the gate's recommended option is `iterate`, pre-filled with the failed steps + their failed criteria — the human still chooses. See `quality-judge.md § Verdict → gate routing`.

Iteration soft cap: warn at `iterations.<phase> >= 3`, force-abort at `>= 5`. Prevents infinite loops.

## Resume via `--from-step=NN`

```bash
/product "ERP para salões de beleza" --from-step=09 --out=/tmp/dogfood-erp
```

Behavior:

1. Phase 0 reads `.state.json` from `<out-dir>/docs/`.
2. **Validates `version`** — must be `5`. If `version == 4`, abort with `state v4 found — older /product run; clear --out dir or run fresh /product`. If `version == 3`, abort with `state v3 found — older /product run; clear --out dir or run fresh /product`. If `version < 3` (v1 or v2), abort with `state v<N> found — older /product run; clear --out dir or run fresh /product`. Conservative: refuse to silently upgrade an older state file, because (1) v4→v5 reshapes Phase 4/5 (a v4 resume into Phase 4 would expect the deleted screen-writer fan-out); (2) v3→v4 changed artifact paths (NN-prefix dropped); (3) v2→v3 changed step numbering.
3. Validates: `slug` matches argument-derived slug; `idea` matches verbatim (case-sensitive); `flags.stack` matches; if mismatch, abort with `state mismatch — clear --out dir or pick different --from-step`.
4. Jumps to step NN. All `completed_steps` entries with step number < NN remain trusted (artifacts on disk are used as inputs to downstream).
5. Continues from there through remaining steps + phases.
6. On clean completion, `flags.from_step` set back to `null` for next invocation.

**Edge case:** `--from-step=NN` where NN is past the user's actual progress. Skill detects (NN > current `step` value), warns, falls back to `step = current` (the actual current step, not requested).

## Failure handling

Sub-agent dispatch returns BLOCKED (DELIVERABLE not met OR sub-agent explicit can't-do):

- **Step 01 (concept brief) or Step 15a (screen-atlas) blocks** → ABORT the run. Step 01 is upstream-of-everything; Step 15a IS the visual contract — Phase 5's SDD handoff has nothing to hand off without it. Step 15b (hi-fi mood) or 15c (fixture-spec) blocking does NOT abort — those degrade gracefully (the atlas alone is a usable contract; a missing hi-fi mood or fixture-spec is a documented gap, logged to `blocked_steps` + REPORT.md, and Phase 5 still runs).
- **Step 07 (sitemap-IA) blocks via schema-enforcement** → AUTO-RETRY with augmented brief naming the uncovered category(ies). Up to 2 retries before falling through to user `iterate` choice at Phase 2 gate.
- **Any other step blocks** → degrade gracefully:
  - Append `{step_label, reason, artifacts_partial: <list>}` to `blocked_steps`.
  - Log to REPORT.md `## Blocked steps` section.
  - Continue to next step. Downstream steps that depend on this one note the gap.

**Quality-judge `fail` is not BLOCKED.** A judge `fail` means the artifact is present and DELIVERABLE-complete but quality-deficient — the step stays in `completed_steps`, not `blocked_steps`. It routes to the phase gate's `iterate` recommendation, never to a BLOCK or abort. `completed_steps` / `blocked_steps` / `quality_verdicts` are three independent records. See `quality-judge.md`.

## Output dir collision

Phase 0 checks if `<out-dir>` exists and is non-empty (any file present):

```
<out-dir> exists and is non-empty. Overwrite? (y/N) ▷
```

- `y` → `rm -r <out-dir>` (NOT `rm -rf` — governance-gate blocks combined flags); then `mkdir -p <out-dir>/docs/screens/hifi <out-dir>/docs/prd <out-dir>/docs/design-system <out-dir>/docs/specs` + init `<out-dir>/docs/.state.json`.
- `n` / no answer / anything else → abort with `aborted; pick a different --out or rm the existing dir yourself`. Exit 0.

No `--force` flag; the prompt is the gate.

## Migration to v5

The v4→v5 change is breaking at the behavioral level: Phase 4 no longer runs a per-route screen-writer fan-out (Step 15 = atlas + hi-fi mood + fixture-spec) and Phase 5 is now the mandatory SDD handoff (was a chat message). A v4 state file resumed under v5 would mis-orchestrate Phase 4/5, so v4 is refused at resume.

No automatic migration. Founders with an in-flight v4 (or older) run must complete it on the prior skill version, or `rm -r <out>` and restart. New runs after the upgrade always start at v5.
